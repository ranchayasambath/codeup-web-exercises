<h3>Acadia National Park</h3>
<ul id="arcadia-park">
    <li>
        From the north, it’s a short and somewhat steep hike to the top of the 1,530-foot peak that first sees the
        glow of sunrise over the Atlantic. Views of the long, rocky ridge of Dorr Mountain keep you company on the way up. Give yourself an hour-and-a-half to reach the summit.
    </li>
    <li>
        An easy, slightly graded walk starts on the south shore of supremely photogenic Jordan Pond, with the twin buttes known
        as the Bubbles looming across the water. The trail network around Jordan Pond offers a variety of lengths and destinations—circle the pond or take a wooded hike beneath the cliffs of Pemetic Mountain.
    </li>
    <li>
        The high point of Mount Desert Island’s western half, 681-foot Acadia Mountain looks out over the blue inlet of Somes Sound,
        often misidentified as a fjord, but not without resemblance to Scandanavia’s dramatic flooded valleys. Set aside four hours for the sometimes steep loop that also passes over nearby St. Sauveur Mountain.
    </li>
    <li>
        Just next door to gentler Gorham Mountain, a trip up the Beehive is not for the faint of heart.
        A deceivingly short half-mile route includes steep switchbacks, exposed ledges, and segments where iron rungs provide hand- and footholds for near-vertical assents.
        The reward is an unsurpassed view of the Atlantic and of Acadia’s beaches and cliffs.

    </li>

</ul>
<h3>Grand Canyon National Park</h3>
<ul id="grand-canyon-park">
    <li>
        Winter means fewer crowds, and fewer crowds means more one-on-one time with knowledgeable park rangers.
        Use this as an opportunity to ask questions about the geology, enjoy longer, more in-depth tours, or simply take a deep breath and appreciate the solitude.
        When else will you have the opportunity to have a 1.2 million-acre park all to yourself?
    </li>
    <li>
        Of the park’s three entrances, only two—the South Rim and Desert View—remain open year-round.
        And while each side has its perks, the easternmost entrance (Desert View) ranks as the most impressive.
        For starters, it’s more remote and harder to get to, so you’re less likely to get stuck behind other cars.
        Plus, if you’re driving up from Flagstaff, you’ll enjoy an incredibly scenic route along US 89, through National Forest, painted desert, and Navajo land.
    </li>
    <li>
        For an entrance fee of $30 per vehicle, visitors certainly get their money’s worth.
        The admission includes access to all sites within the park, as well as parking, shuttle bus service, and, most importantly, access to guided ranger tours.
        The website’s calendar offers detailed descriptions of the various geology talks and wildlife tours scheduled throughout the week—a worthwhile resource,
        if you want some of those burning questions (Why are the rocks red? How deep is Grand Canyon? When did it form?) answered.
    </li>
    <li>
        There are six hotels located inside the sprawling park, though only one of them, El Tovar Hotel, truly caters to the luxury set.
        Built right on the rim, the 1905 Swiss-style chalet couples fabulous views with high-end dining (Teddy Roosevelt and Albert Einstein both were guests here).
        Just don’t expect to enjoy it all from your window: architect Charles Whittlesey oriented the building in such a way that guests are forced to venture outside their rooms and experience the canyon up-close.
    </li>

</ul>
<h3>Biscayne National Park</h3>
<ul id="biscayne-park">
    <li>
        One of Biscayne National Park’s claims to fame is its collection of six separate shipwrecks, the oldest of which is a 1,480-ton iron-hulled steamship dating back to 1878.
        The Maritime Heritage Trail, explained Johnson, offers exciting opportunities for snorkelers to experience a shipwreck in a beautiful natural setting. Access, of course, is by boat and flipper only.
    </li>
    <li>
        Most travelers begin a trip to Biscayne National Park at the Dante Fascell Visitor Center: an unflashy boathouse-type structure that offers unlimited resources for newbies to the region.
        From here, you can visit a museum that explains the park’s different ecosystems (there are four, in case you’re wondering: mangroves, Biscayne Bay, Florida Keys, coral reef), or speak to a park ranger about renting a boat.
    </li>
    <li>
        Boca Chita, a small island off the northern tip of Elliott Key, can only be accessed by boat, and is a must-see for anyone paddling his or her way through the bay.
        The island’s centerpiece is an impressive 55-foot-tall lighthouse that dates back to the 1930s,
        when the island was still privately owned. Nature enthusiasts should hike the half-mile promenade that curves along the edge of the harbor, ringed with swaying Thatch Palms and stunning views.

        When night falls, plan on sticking around. The utterly secluded Boca Chita campground offers picnic tables and BBQ grills, and aside from the overnight docking fee you’ll pay upon arrival ($25),
        use of the campgrounds is totally free. As the sun sets, look north—you can see the Miami skyline glowing in the distance.
    </li>
    <li>
        Though Biscayne National Park isn’t technically considered part of the Florida Keys, you’d never know it.
        The park’s combination of aquamarine waters, brilliant emerald islands, and coral reefs represent a truly remarkable sight, especially for first-time visitors to Florida. And the best way to see it all is to get out on the water.

        The park makes it easy for visitors to rent boats right at the dock. Simply show up at the visitor center to sign out a paddleboard or kayak,
        and away you go. Soon, you’ll be paddling through ancient rows of mangroves, but no one’s stopping you from charting your own course. With full access to Biscayne Bay’s seven-mile expanse,
        you’ll only be limited by your own sense of adventure (and rowing stamina).
